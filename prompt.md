Case Study
Overview
You are tasked with building a backend system for an e-commerce 
platform that handles real-time order processing. The system 
should efficiently manage incoming orders, process payments, 
update inventory, and notify other services (like shipping and 
notification) about the order status. The architecture must leverage 
a messaging system (like Apache Kafka) for asynchronous 
processing and a database for storing order details and inventory.
Functional Requirements
&#x2751; Order Placement:
Users should be able to place orders via an API endpoint.
&#x2022; Each order should include details such as user ID, product IDs, 
quantities, and payment information.
&#x2751; Messaging System:
&#x2022; Use Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ or a similar messaging bus) to 
decouple services.
&#x2022; When an order is placed, publish an &#x22;OrderPlaced&#x22; event to a 
topic for pub-sub mechanism.
&#x2751; Order Processing:
&#x2022; Create a separate microservice that listens for &#x22;OrderPlaced&#x22; 
events.
&#x2022; This service should:
&#x2022; Validate the order.
&#x2022; Process the payment (mock payment service).
&#x2022; Update the inventory in the database.
&#x2022; Publish an &#x22;OrderProcessed&#x22; event to another Kafka 
topic.
&#x2751; Inventory Management:
&#x2022; Create another microservice to listen for &#x22;OrderProcessed&#x22; 
events.
&#x2022; This service should:
&#x2022; Update the inventory based on the order.
&#x2022; If inventory is below a certain threshold, publish a 
&#x22;LowStock&#x22; event.

**Sage**:

To build a backend system for an e-commerce platform that meets the outlined requirements, we'll design a microservices architecture using Python, Flask for the API, Apache Kafka for messaging, and PostgreSQL for the database. Here's a step-by-step guide and complete code examples for each component of the system.

### 1. System Overview

The system will consist of:
- **API Service**: Handles incoming HTTP requests to place orders.
- **Order Processor Service**: Listens to `OrderPlaced` events and processes orders.
- **Inventory Management Service**: Listens to `OrderProcessed` events and manages inventory.

### 2. Technologies Used
- **Flask**: For creating the API.
- **Apache Kafka**: For messaging between services.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing order and inventory data.
- **Docker**: Optional, for containerizing the services.

### 3. Setting Up Apache Kafka

First, ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running. You can use Docker for simplicity:

```bash
docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --name kafka -e ADVERTISED_HOST=localhost -e NUM_PARTITIONS=1 -d wurstmeister/kafka
```

### 4. API Service

This service will expose an endpoint to place orders.

#### Required Libraries

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
from kafka import KafkaProducer

app = Flask(__name__)
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
```

#### API Endpoint

```python
@app.route('/order', methods=['POST'])
def place_order():
    data = request.json
    producer.send('OrderPlaced', json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8'))
    return jsonify({"status": "Order placed"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

### 5. Order Processor Service

This microservice listens for `OrderPlaced` events, processes them, and publishes `OrderProcessed` events.

#### Required Libraries

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer, KafkaProducer
import json

consumer = KafkaConsumer('OrderPlaced', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', auto_offset_reset='earliest')
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
```

#### Processing Logic

```python
for message in consumer:
    order = json.loads(message.value)
    # Process order logic (mock payment and inventory check)
    print("Processing order:", order)
    # Mock update to database would occur here
    producer.send('OrderProcessed', json.dumps(order).encode('utf-8'))
```

### 6. Inventory Management Service

This service listens for `OrderProcessed` events and manages inventory.

#### Required Libraries

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer, KafkaProducer
import json

consumer = KafkaConsumer('OrderProcessed', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', auto_offset_reset='earliest')
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
```

#### Inventory Management Logic

```python
for message in consumer:
    order = json.loads(message.value)
    print("Updating inventory for order:", order)
    # Inventory update logic here
    # Check if inventory is low and publish LowStock event
    # producer.send('LowStock', json.dumps({"product_id": product_id}).encode('utf-8'))
```

### 7. Running the Services

Each Python script should be run in its own process/environment. Ensure Kafka is accessible and that each topic (`OrderPlaced`, `OrderProcessed`) is created.

### Conclusion

This setup provides a robust starting point for a microservices-based e-commerce backend. Each service is decoupled, communicating asynchronously via Kafka. This ensures scalability and maintainability. Further enhancements could include adding authentication, more sophisticated error handling, and integrating real payment and inventory management systems.

**User**:

write a code to build this functionality using node js, postgres, and kafka-node library

**Sage**:

To build the backend system for an e-commerce platform using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and the kafka-node library, we'll create three main components: an API service for order placement, an order processor service, and an inventory management service. Below is a detailed guide and complete code examples for each component.

### 1. System Overview

The system will consist of:
- **API Service**: Handles incoming HTTP requests to place orders.
- **Order Processor Service**: Listens to `OrderPlaced` events and processes orders.
- **Inventory Management Service**: Listens to `OrderProcessed` events and manages inventory.

### 2. Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For creating the services.
- **Express**: For handling HTTP requests in the API service.
- **kafka-node**: For interaction with Apache Kafka.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing order and inventory data.
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

### 3. Setting Up Apache Kafka

Ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running. You can use Docker for simplicity:

```bash
docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --name kafka -e ADVERTISED_HOST=localhost -e NUM_PARTITIONS=1 -d wurstmeister/kafka
```

### 4. API Service

This service will expose an endpoint to place orders.

#### Required Libraries and Initialization

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { Kafka } = require('kafka-node');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const client = new Kafka.KafkaClient({ kafkaHost: 'localhost:9092' });
const producer = new Kafka.Producer(client);
```

#### API Endpoint

```javascript
app.post('/order', (req, res) => {
    const payloads = [
        { topic: 'OrderPlaced', messages: JSON.stringify(req.body) }
    ];
    producer.send(payloads, (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            res.status(500).send('Failed to place order');
        } else {
            res.status(200).send({ status: 'Order placed', data });
        }
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API service listening on port 3000'));
```

### 5. Order Processor Service

This microservice listens for `OrderPlaced` events, processes them, and publishes `OrderProcessed` events.

#### Required Libraries and Initialization

```javascript
const { Kafka } = require('kafka-node');

const client = new Kafka.KafkaClient({ kafkaHost: 'localhost:9092' });
const consumer = new Kafka.Consumer(client, [{ topic: 'OrderPlaced', partition: 0 }]);
const producer = new Kafka.Producer(client);
```

#### Processing Logic

```javascript
consumer.on('message', function(message) {
    const order = JSON.parse(message.value);
    console.log("Processing order:", order);
    // Process order logic (mock payment and inventory check)
    const processedOrder = { ...order, status: 'Processed' };
    const payloads = [
        { topic: 'OrderProcessed', messages: JSON.stringify(processedOrder) }
    ];
    producer.send(payloads, (err, data) => {
        if (err) console.log('Error processing order:', err);
    });
});
```

### 6. Inventory Management Service

This service listens for `OrderProcessed` events and manages inventory.

#### Required Libraries and Initialization

```javascript
const { Kafka } = require('kafka-node');

const client = new Kafka.KafkaClient({ kafkaHost: 'localhost:9092' });
const consumer = new Kafka.Consumer(client, [{ topic: 'OrderProcessed', partition: 0 }]);
```

#### Inventory Management Logic

```javascript
consumer.on('message', function(message) {
    const order = JSON.parse(message.value);
    console.log("Updating inventory for order:", order);
    // Inventory update logic here
    // Check if inventory is low and publish LowStock event
});
```

### 7. Running the Services

Each Node.js script should be run in its own process/environment. Ensure Kafka is accessible and that each topic (`OrderPlaced`, `OrderProcessed`) is created.

### Conclusion

This setup provides a robust starting point for a microservices-based e-commerce backend using Node.js, Kafka, and PostgreSQL. Each service is decoupled, communicating asynchronously via Kafka, which ensures scalability and maintainability. Further enhancements could include adding authentication, more sophisticated error handling, and integrating real payment and inventory management systems.

**User**:

write the postgres db operations code for order placements and inventory management as per business requirement. 

**Sage**:

To handle PostgreSQL database operations for order placements and inventory management in the context of the Node.js-based e-commerce platform, we'll need to perform several tasks. These include inserting new orders into the database, updating inventory levels, and checking for low stock conditions. Below, I provide detailed code examples for each of these operations using the `pg` module, which is a popular PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

### Setting Up PostgreSQL

First, ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. You'll need to create a database and the necessary tables. Here's a simple schema setup:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Placed'
);

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    stock INT NOT NULL
);
```

### Node.js PostgreSQL Database Operations

#### Required Libraries and Database Connection Setup

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'yourUsername',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'ecommerce',
    password: 'yourPassword',
    port: 5432,
});

const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        await pool.connect();
        console.log('Connected to the database');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Database connection error', err.stack);
    }
};

connectDB();
```

#### Order Placement Database Operations

When an order is placed, you need to insert the order details into the `orders` table and update the inventory in the `inventory` table.

```javascript
const placeOrder = async (userId, productId, quantity) => {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
        await client.query('BEGIN');

        const orderInsertText = 'INSERT INTO orders(user_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *';
        const orderInsertValues = [userId, productId, quantity];
        const orderResult = await client.query(orderInsertText, orderInsertValues);
        console.log('Order Inserted:', orderResult.rows[0]);

        const inventoryUpdateText = 'UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - $1 WHERE product_id = $2 RETURNING *';
        const inventoryUpdateValues = [quantity, productId];
        const inventoryResult = await client.query(inventoryUpdateText, inventoryUpdateValues);
        console.log('Inventory Updated:', inventoryResult.rows[0]);

        await client.query('COMMIT');
        return orderResult.rows[0];
    } catch (e) {
        await client.query('ROLLBACK');
        throw e;
    } finally {
        client.release();
    }
};
```

#### Inventory Management Database Operations

For inventory management, particularly checking for low stock, you can create a function that checks the inventory levels after each update and publishes a `LowStock` event if necessary.

```javascript
const checkLowStock = async (productId) => {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
        const queryText = 'SELECT stock FROM inventory WHERE product_id = $1';
        const queryValues = [productId];
        const result = await client.query(queryText, queryValues);
        const stock = result.rows[0].stock;

        if (stock < 10) { // Assuming low stock threshold is 10
            console.log('Low stock for product:', productId);
            // Here you would typically publish a LowStock event to Kafka
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.error('Error checking stock', e);
    } finally {
        client.release();
    }
};
```

### Conclusion

These functions integrate PostgreSQL operations into your Node.js application for handling order placements and inventory management. They ensure that all database interactions are handled transactionally to maintain data integrity. This setup is crucial for the real-time processing requirements of an e-commerce platform.
